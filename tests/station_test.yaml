# Example YAML Station configuration file
#
# This file gets snapshotted and can be read back from the JSON
# snapshot for every experiment run.
#
# All fields are optional unless explicitly mentioned otherwise.
#
# As in all YAML files a one-line notation can also be used
# instead of nesting notation.
#
# The file starts with a list of loadable instruments instances,
# i.e. there can be two entries for two instruments of the same
# type if you want to specify two different use cases
# e.g. "dmm1-readout" and "dmm1-calibration".
