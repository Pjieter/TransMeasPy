Instrument-agnostic electronic transport measurement framework built on top of qcodes. TransMeasPy structures experiments around independent (set) and dependent (measured) variables, captures comprehensive instrument and sample metadata for reproducibility, enforces safety limits, and supports adaptable, stoppable measurements.
