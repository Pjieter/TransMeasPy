# Implement Runtime Parameter Adaptation

**Priority:** Medium
**Labels:** enhancement, runtime-control, adaptive

## Description

Create adaptive measurement capabilities that:
- Allow modification of scan parameters during execution
- Implement adaptive current limits based on real-time conditions
- Support 2D field-temperature sweeps with adaptive parameters
- Maintain data consistency during parameter changes
- Log all parameter modifications with timestamps

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Runtime parameter modification interface
- [ ] Adaptive limit algorithms
- [ ] Support for multi-dimensional adaptive scans
- [ ] Data consistency during parameter changes
- [ ] Parameter change logging and history
- [ ] Examples of adaptive measurements
- [ ] Integration with safety limits
