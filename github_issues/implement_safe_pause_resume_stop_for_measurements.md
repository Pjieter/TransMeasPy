# Implement Safe Pause/Resume/Stop for Measurements

**Priority:** Medium
**Labels:** enhancement, runtime-control

## Description

Create runtime control capabilities that:
- Allow safe pausing of measurements without data loss
- Enable resuming from exact pause point
- Implement clean stopping with data preservation
- Handle instrument state management during pauses
- Provide transaction/rollback semantics for partial data

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Pause functionality with state preservation
- [ ] Resume capability from pause point
- [ ] Safe stop with data integrity
- [ ] Instrument state management
- [ ] Transaction semantics for data
- [ ] Recovery from unexpected interruptions
- [ ] User interface for runtime control
- [ ] Integration tests for all control scenarios
