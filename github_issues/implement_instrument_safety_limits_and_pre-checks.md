# Implement Instrument Safety Limits and Pre-checks

**Priority:** High
**Labels:** enhancement, safety, limits

## Description

- [ ] Pre-measurement validation engine
- [ ] Integration with instrument drivers
- [ ] Configurable safety thresholds
- [ ] Clear error reporting
- [ ] Documentation for setting up limits
- [ ] Unit tests for limit checking
