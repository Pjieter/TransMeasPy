# Implement Runtime Safety Monitoring and Interlocks

**Priority:** High
**Labels:** enhancement, safety, runtime

## Description

Create runtime safety monitoring that:
- Continuously monitors instrument parameters during measurements
- Implements software interlocks for critical limits
- Provides automatic shutdown on safety violations
- Logs all safety events with timestamps
- Allows configurable monitoring intervals

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Runtime monitoring framework
- [ ] Configurable interlock system
- [ ] Automatic shutdown procedures
- [ ] Safety event logging
- [ ] Recovery and restart capabilities
- [ ] Performance optimization for monitoring overhead
- [ ] Integration tests with safety scenarios
