# Review Current Quantify vs QCodes Architecture Decision

**Priority:** High
**Labels:** architecture, review, breaking-change

## Description

The current implementation uses quantify_core framework, but the scope document specifies using qcodes as the foundation. This needs architectural review:
- Evaluate benefits/drawbacks of current quantify_core approach
- Compare with pure qcodes implementation
- Assess migration effort if change is needed
- Make architectural decision and document rationale

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Architecture comparison document
- [ ] Performance and feature analysis
- [ ] Migration effort assessment
- [ ] Architectural decision record (ADR)
- [ ] Implementation plan for chosen approach
- [ ] Update scope document if needed

## References

Issue #1 scope states 'Use qcodes as the foundation' but current code uses quantify_core

## Additional Notes

This issue is derived from the comprehensive scope definition in Issue #1: "Define Scope, Objectives, and Project Boundaries for TransMeasPy Python Package".
