# Implement Data Model with Independent/Dependent Variables

**Priority:** High
**Labels:** enhancement, architecture, data-model

## Description

Design and implement the fundamental data model that:
- Clearly separates parameters set (independent) vs parameters measured (dependent)
- Uses qcodes dataset as foundation
- Supports HDF5 and JSON export formats
- Includes versioning for data structure evolution
- Maintains backward compatibility

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Core data structure implementation
- [ ] Integration with qcodes datasets
- [ ] HDF5 export functionality
- [ ] JSON export functionality
- [ ] Data versioning system
- [ ] Documentation and examples
- [ ] Unit tests for data model
