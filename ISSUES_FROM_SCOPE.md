## Summary

This breakdown creates **12 distinct issues** from the original scope document, organized by priority and functional area. Each issue is specific, actionable, and includes clear acceptance criteria. The issues are designed to be worked on in logical order, with foundation and architecture issues taking priority over user-facing features.

**Recommended Creation Order:**
1. Architecture Review (quantify vs qcodes)
2. Metadata schemas (samples/devices and instruments)  
3. Data model implementation
4. Safety limits and pre-checks
5. Runtime safety monitoring
6. Dependencies and testing strategy
7. Error handling and recovery
8. Runtime control features
9. Documentation and examples
10. CLI interface

This approach ensures that core architectural decisions are made first, followed by foundational components, safety features, and finally user-facing functionality.
